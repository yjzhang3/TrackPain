## Introduction

This is the third part of the Hack$rare solution Trackpain, an inference model that can help predict pain levels for non-communicative children. Please refer to [this page](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn26015614/wiki/) for the complete solution.

To show a proof of concept, we use an imaginary person whose biological data and pain scales are recorded. We will show how to construct a network for this particular individual patient. 

## Data preparation
