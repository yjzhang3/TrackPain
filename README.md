## Introduction

This is the third part of the Hack$rare solution Trackpain, an inference model that can help predict pain levels for non-communicative children. Please refer to [this page](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn26015614/wiki/) for the complete solution.

To show a proof of concept, we use an imaginary person whose biological data and pain scales are recorded. We will show how to construct a network for this particular individual patient. 

## Data preparation

- The sensor will collect biological data including heart rate variability, respiration rate, actigraphy, and skin conductance
- The phone app will collect self-reported metrics obtained from visual pain analog, including facial and emotional scores; the third party caregivers can also make observations about eating, sleeping, social, and verbal patterns. 
- Refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/yjzhang3/TrackPain/blob/main/Data-Pro.ipynb) for data cleaning probabilty calculation. 

## Modeling and inference
- Given probabilities value, create a static binary discrete Bayesian network
- Refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/yjzhang3/TrackPain/blob/main/TrackPain-Bayesian-Preliminary.ipynb) for model creation and prediction

## Future consideration 
- Make a continuous instead of discrete network
- following this pipeline, construct a dynamic network that fits all patients data

## Debug
- Note that we are trying to solve the error in network creation. See [Issue Section](
